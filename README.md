A real-time fractal viewer


## Info
Yet another one of my personal projects. I am actually kind of proud of this one. 
Running it requires a decent GPU, I would imagine, and building it on Windows is
a pain. 

It's complete with waypoints, sound and a wide variety of colors. Keybinds are as follows:


    f(1..3) (example: the key f1) + shift = set current position as waypoint
    f(1..3) = load waypoint

    movement with arrow keys

    Q = decrease iterations
    E = increase iterations

    W = zoom in fast
    S = zoom out fast

    D = zoom in slow
    A = zoom out slow
    
    1..7 change fractal color
    

Movement doesn't work that well, when zoomed in beyond a certain point.
